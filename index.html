    <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
      in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h1>

    <p>‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
      The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
      the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

    <h1>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h1>

    <p>‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
      for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

    <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
      learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>

    <p>‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
      gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
      junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

    <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>

    <p>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
      professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
      did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
      could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
      100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
